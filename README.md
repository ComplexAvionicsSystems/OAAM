# OAAM - Open Avionics Architecture Model

OAAM is an open source domain specific model for describing modern avionics architectures including Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA). It is intended for planning, optimizing and comparing multiple large scale avionics architectures. It offers a rigid resource and constraint model. Moreover, it is intended to be the system description language and avionics platformâ€™s consciousness of future configurations-less self-organizing avionics systems, so called adaptive or autonomic platforms.
